				<h2>1. Experimental Setup</h2>
				<p>The goal of the experiments was to answer the question of how the incorporation of epistemic logic
					influenced the outcome of the game of mafia.
					To test this, we will run our model of mafia with a total of five players: two villagers, two
					mafiosi, and one detective.
					This configuration was chosen as it is the minimal configuration that incorporates the extra
					knowledge of mafia, and the special ability of the detective while having the townfolk be a
					majority. Configurations with larger amount of players were found to exponentially increase the
					computational costs and result in them becoming too large to be able to run the simulation.
					<br />
					To answer our research question, we will run the simulation in two ways. Namely, one in which all
					agents vote randomly and the mafia randomly decides who to
					kill and one in which the voting and killing strategies discussed in the <a
						href="Logic & Implementation.html">Implementation</a> page.
					<br />
					Moreover, when running the simulation with the incorporation of epistemic logic, we will keep count
					of the average sociability <em>s</em> of agents, so that we can determine what the influence of
					<i>s</i> is on the result of the games.
					We do this, as we suppose that a higher <em>s</em> should provide for more conversations and
					therefore more strategizing. Therefore, it should allow us to get a clearer insight into the
					influence of epistemic logic on the overall result. Note that the probability of being marked
					suspicious will always be set to 25%.

					<br />
					All configurations will be ran 100 times, keeping track of who won the as the evaluation metric.
