				<h2>1. Experimental Setup</h2>
				<p>The goal of the experiments was to answer the question of how the incorporation of epistemic logic
					influenced the outcome of the game of mafia.
					To test this, we will run our model of mafia with a total of six players: three villagers, two
					mafiosi, and one detective.
					This configuration was chosen as it is the minimal configuration that incorporates the extra
					knowledge of mafia, and the special ability of the detective while having the townfolk be a
					majority. Configurations with larger amount of players were found to exponentially increase the
					computational costs and result in them becoming too large to be able to run the simulation.
					<br />
					To answer our research question, we will run the simulation in two ways. Namely, one in which all
					agents vote randomly and the mafia randomly decides who to
					kill and one in which the voting and killing strategies discussed in the <a
						href="Logic & Implementation.html">Implementation</a> page are used.
					<br />
					Moreover, when running the simulation with the incorporation of epistemic logic, we will keep count
					of the average sociability <em>s</em> of agents, so that we can determine what the influence of
					<i>s</i> is on the result of the games.
					We do this, as we suppose that a higher <em>s</em> should provide for more conversations and
					therefore more strategizing. Therefore, it should allow us to get a clearer insight into the
					influence of epistemic logic on the overall result. Note that the probability of being marked
					suspicious will always be set to 25%, the maximum number of talks to be had is set to 3 and that for
					all agents <em>s</em> is sampled from a uniform distribution between 0 and 0.5.

					<br />
					The model will be ran across both strategies for a total of 100 times, keeping track of what
					faction
					won the as the evaluation
					metric.
				</p>


				<h2>2. Results</h2>
				<h3>2.1 Incorporation of Logic</h3>
				Figure 5 shows the winrates of both factions with and without the incorporation of logic. We observe
				that when voting randomly, the townfolk win more often than not. Moreover, when logic is incorporated
				into the model, the townfolk manages to get up to a winrate of 77% which is significantly higher than
				the 64% achieved when voting randomly.

				<h3>2.2 Influence of Conversations</h3>
				Figure 2 shows the winrate of the townfolk across the different sociability values. Note that logic is
				incorporated in these runs, as sociability has no function in the random case.
				We observe that a higher sociability causes a higher winrate, albeit that some differences between bins
				fall within the standard deviation.
