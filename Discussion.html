					The goal of this research was to investigate the influence of incorporating epistemic logic into a
					model of the Mafia game. To accomplish this, we conducted two simulations: one without logic where
					agents voted and killed randomly, and another where agents utilized various epistemic logic rules to
					reason and make decisions.
					<br />
					Our results clearly demonstrate that logic enhances the performance of townfolk in our specific
					player configuration. This outcome is expected since, in a random scenario, the mafia is not
					consistently voted out, allowing them to eliminate players quickly. However, when agents employ
					logic, they can coordinate their votes more effectively by utilizing information such as the
					detective's inspections.
					<br />
					Furthermore, we examined the impact of sociability, a stat representing the likelihood of agent
					interactions, on the game's outcome. We found that increasing sociability values resulted in a
					higher win rate for the townfolk when logic was employed. This suggests that more conversations,
					facilitated by logic, are beneficial for the townfolk. This observation aligns intuitively with the
					fact that the mafiaa is always marked as suspicious in our model, and engaging in conversations with
					them is the only way to uncover their identities.
					<br />
					In our model of the Mafia game, we explored several aspects and made certain simplifications. It's
					important to note that we did not incorporate the ability for agents to choose whom to talk to
					during the game. Instead, conversations between agents were automatically initiated without any
					specific strategy involved in selecting communication partners. Agents could have potentially
					avoided talking to agents they had already conversed with if they had a strategic approach, which
					might have impacted the results.
					<br />
					Another notable aspect of our model is that agents are unaware of whether they are acting suspicious or
					not. As a result, in some cases, multiple possible worlds remain when the game concludes. It would
					have been logical to introduce self-knowledge to the agents, as is typically the case in real-life
					interactions. For example, after a conversation, one usually becomes aware if the other party
					considers them suspicious, such as when they exhibit signs of nervousness or hesitation.
					<br />
					Additionally, our detective agent did not strategically inspect players to gather information.
					Instead, the detective role investigated random players. However, targeted investigations do make
					sense in our model since villagers can also exhibit suspicious behavior, allowing the detective to
					verify whether a player acting suspiciously is indeed a member of the mafia. This should thus 
					be added in a future iteration.
					<br />
					Despite these simplifications and variations, our model provides valuable insights into the
					mechanics of the Mafia game. It serves as a foundation for further exploration and can be extended
					to incorporate additional features, roles, and new strategic elements.
