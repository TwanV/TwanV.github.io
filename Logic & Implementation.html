				<!-- Agents -->
				<h2>1. Agents</h2>
				<p>In our model, there are three types of agent roles: villager, mafia, and detective. We have chosen
					to limit the roles to three to keep the model relatively simple. The roles of Mafia and Villager are
					essential for the
					game, but to further incorporate logic, the role of detective has been added.
					Each role has its own
					characteristics and abilities:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Villager</strong>
						is a passive role, that is only able to participate in voting during the day phase.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Mafia</strong> is a more knowledgable and powerful role. They know who the other mafiosi
						are and are able to murder other players during the night phase.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>The detective</strong> is able to inspect any player's role during the night, being the
						only role that gets to expand its knowledge
						in a different way from conversations. The detective is part of the townfolk,
						meaning he/she works together with the villagers.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					During the day phase, all agents have the ability to interact with each other before voting. This
					interaction allows them to gather information and identify potential mafia members who may be acting
					suspiciously. To determine the likelihood of agents initiating a conversation, we assign each of
					them a
					sociability stat (<i>s</i>), randomly sampled from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. At the
					beginning of
					the day phase, another random number between 0 and 1 is sampled. If an agent's <i>s</i> is
					greater than or equal to this number, they are marked as wanting to engage in a conversation.
					Conversations can only occur between two agents if both of them are marked as wanting to talk.

					In the actual game of Mafia, player conversations provide valuable information as participants
					observe
					human behavior cues such as stuttering, excessive blinking, or signs of lying to identify suspicious
					individuals. Additionally, the mafia attempts to
					manipulate other agents into voting for innocent townsfolk instead of themselves. However, in our
					model,
					we limit conversations to two players, allowing them to assess whether the other agent is displaying
					suspicious behavior or not.

					The subsequent sections will provide further details on the implementation of suspicion and how
					agents
					behave when they suspect another agent.</p>

				<!-- Knowledge types -->
				<h2>2. Knowledge and Rules</h2>
				<h3>2.1 Knowledge Types</h3>

				There are three types of knowledge we represent in the model, namely:
				<ul>
					<li>Role-related knowledge: Agent <i>i</i> is a villager, mafiosi or detective =
						<i>v<sub>i</sub></i>,
						<i>m<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>d<sub>i</sub></i>, respectively
					</li>
					<li>Knowledge of that agent <i>i</i> is acting suspiciously: <i>sus<sub>i</sub></i></li>
					<li>Knowledge of that agent <i>i</i> has been killed: <i>dead<sub>i</sub></i></li>
				</ul>

				<!-- Reasoning: Gaining Knowledge -->
				<h3>2.2 Rules</h3>
				The following rules represent the logical rules of our model. With rule 1 through 4 dealing with how
				agents can obtain
				knowledge and rule 5 and 6 deal with how the agents use it in voting.

				<ol>
					<li>As mentioned above, suspicion of an agent can occur during conversation.
						To elaborate on this, mafia are always considered to be acting suspiciously as this is inherent
						to their role: <strong><i>m<sub>i</sub></i> &rarr; <i>sus<sub>i</sub></i></strong>. Note that it
						is also possible
						for other roles to act suspicious, which will be explained in Section 3.</li>
					<li>Agents get suspicious of each other based on the conversations they have with each other:
						<strong>(<i>agent<sub>i</sub></i> talks to <i>agent<sub>j</sub></i> &and;
							<i>sus<sub>j</sub></i>) &rarr; <i>K<sub>i</sub>sus<sub>j</sub></i></strong>.
					</li>
					<li>Agents get to know each other's suspicions through conversation:
						<strong>(<i>agent<sub>i</sub></i> talks to <i>agent<sub>j</sub></i> &and;
							<i>K<sub>j</sub>sus<sub>k</sub></i>) &rarr;
							<i>K<sub>i</sub>K<sub>j</sub>sus<sub>k</sub></i></strong>.
					</li>
					<li>The detective can get to know whether another agent is Mafia with his special ability:
						<ol class="margin-0">
							<li><strong>(<i>d<sub>i</sub></i> &and; <i>inspect agent<sub>j</sub></i> &and;
									<i>m<sub>j</sub></i>) &rarr; <i>K<sub>i</sub>m<sub>j</sub></i></strong>
							</li>
							<li><strong>(<i>d<sub>i</sub></i> &and; <i>inspect agent<sub>j</sub></i> &and;
									&not;<i>m<sub>j</sub></i>)&rarr; <i>K<sub>i</sub>&not;m<sub>j</sub></i></strong>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Mafia murder and vote on (in order)</li>
					<ol class="margin-0">
						<li>Agents that they know are suspicious of them:
							<strong><i>K<sub>i</sub>K<sub>j</sub>sus<sub>i</sub></i>
								&and; &not; <i>dead<sub>j</sub></i></strong>
						</li>
						<li>A random agent</li>
					</ol>
					<li>Townfolk vote on (in order):</li>
					<ol class="margin-0">
						<li>Agents that they are suspicous of: <strong><i>K<sub>i</sub>sus<sub>j</sub></i> &and; &not;
								<i>dead<sub>j</sub></i></strong>.
						</li>
						<li>Agents they know other agents are suspicous of:
							<strong><i>K<sub>i</sub>K<sub>j</sub>sus<sub>k</sub></i> &and; &not;
							<i>dead<sub>k</sub></i></strong>. We consider this as a second, less trustworthy type of
							knowledge as it is the agents have not conversated with the suspicious agent themselves.
						</li>
						<li>A random agent </li>
					</ol>
				</ol>
				<p>In our simulation, it is important to note that a voting tie can occur when using rules 5 and 6. To
					address this situation, we have chosen to randomly resolve the tie and eliminate a player. This
					decision
					was made to prevent the simulation from getting stuck in a stalemate, where all agents continuously
					vote
					for the same player and ties occur in a repetitive loop. Randomly resolving ties is also a
					recognized
					approach in real-life Mafia games to break voting deadlocks <a href="References.html">[2]</a>.</p>

				<h2>3. The Kripke Model</h2>
				<p>To model the agents knowledge and what they consider to be possible, we use a kripke model <a
						href="References.html">[3]</a>. This is a
					mathematical structure used in modal logic to represent the knowledge and belief states of agents in
					a
					system. It consists of a set of possible worlds, each with its own interpretation of propositions,
					and a
					set of accessibility relations that describe the relationships between worlds and the agents'
					beliefs
					about those relationships. The Kripke model provides a framework for reasoning about the logical
					properties of knowledge, belief, and other modalities within a given system and is thus very
					suitable for our
					multi agent system of Mafia.</p>

				<!-- Model Initialization: Worlds -->
				<h3>3.1 Initialization</h3>
				<p>Our Kripke model represents the different combinations of roles and suspicions in the game scenario.
					It is initialized with every possible permutation of the chosen roles, along with possible
					combinations for which agents can be suspicious. As mentioned previously, mafia is always considered
					to be acting suspiciously. Alongside this however, we mark every other role as suspicious with a
					probabilitiy of <em>p</em>. This means that it is indeed possible for every single agent to act
					suspiciously, which results in various extra worlds in the intialization.

					To examplify, say we have a game with two villagers, two mafiosi, and one detective.
					Considering the possible combinations of roles, we have a total of 5!/(2!2!1!) = 30 different role
					assignments for the players.

					Additionally, we have the concept of suspicions, where each player can be suspicious or not
					suspicious. Since the mafia is always suspicious, we don't consider different possibilities for
					their suspicions. However, the villagers and detective can be suspicious or not suspicious,
					resulting in 2^3 = 8 different combinations of suspicions for these players.

					Therefore, in our model, we have a total of 30 * 8 = 240 different worlds in the Kripke model, each
					representing a unique combination of roles and suspicions for the players.

					As for the relation, we consider the following:
				<ul>
					<li>Every agent knows their own role meaning that they can only distinguish between worlds where the
						their role is assigned in the same way::
						&forall;((<i>v<sub>x</sub> &rarr; K<sub>x</sub>v<sub>x</sub></i>) &and; (<i>m<sub>x</sub>
							&rarr; K<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub> </i>) &and; (<i>d<sub>x</sub> &rarr;
							K<sub>x</sub>d<sub>x</sub> </i>))
					</li>
					<li>Mafia knows who the other mafia is, meaning that they can only distinguish between worlds where
						the mafia role is assigned in the same way:
						&forall;<sub>x</sub>(<i>m<sub>x</sub> &rarr; </i>&forall;<i>y(m<sub>y</sub> &rarr;
							K<sub>x</sub>m<sub>y</sub> </i>))
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>An example initialization of four agents is provided in Figure 1. Note that the names of the worlds
					are the first letter of the roles of the agents in order, with a star behind the letter meaning the
					agent is marked as suspicious.</p>
